# PRODIGY_CS_02
I have developed a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. We can perform operation like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel, which allow user to encrypt and decrypt images.

#Task 2

1. Image Encryption Tool

This Python program implements a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The program can encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic mathematical operations on the pixel values. It is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through the encryption and decryption processes with clear prompts.

2. Features :
   
> Image Encryption: Users can encrypt an image by applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value, effectively altering the image.
> Image Decryption: The program can reverse the encryption process to restore the original image.
> User Input:  Users can specify the image file and the encryption key.
> File Handling: The program saves the encrypted and decrypted images to specified file paths.

3. How It Works

> Encrypt Image: Multiplies each pixel value by a key and then divides by the key plus one to create the encrypted image.
> Decrypt Image: Reverses the encryption process by multiplying each pixel value by the key plus one and then dividing by the key.

4. Usage 

> Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Image Encryption program.
> Select Action: Choose 'e' for encryption, 'd' for decryption, or 'q' to quit.

5. Encrypt Image:

> Enter the encryption key.
> Specify the location or URL of the image to be encrypted.

6. Decrypt Image:
   
> Enter the decryption key.
> Specify the location of the encrypted image.

7. View Results:
   
>The program saves and indicates the location of the encrypted and decrypted images.
   
This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, showcasing a basic approach to image encryption and decryption through pixel manipulation.
